String formatting

1. using comma to format the string and the variables
2. % operator
3. format() method of the string
4. using f-strings

1. Using comma to format the string and variables
==================================================
age = 20
name = "Umakant"
company = "CTS"
salary = 67345.65
# Umakant who is of age 20 is working for CTS and is earning a salary of 67345.65 Rs.
print(name, "who is of age",age,"is working for", company, "and is earning a salary of",salary)

2. % operator
==================================================

used to format a string as well as numbers
after the string place %followed by the argument specifiers and after the string, mention the identifiers in parameters
the %will take only one argument for the parameters

Argument Specifiers:
%s - represents String
%d - represents integer
%f - floating point (it takes 6 digit after the decimal point)
%<number_of_digits>f - floating point with a fixed amount of digits after the decimal point


format()

It is an in-built method of String
It formats the string at the places where curly braces are placed
Limitation:
	If the manual indexing is used, automatic indexing will be obsolete

f-Strings:
In case of f-string, mention the identifier in curly braces
f should be present outside the curly braces
print(f"{name} who is of age {age} is working for {company} and is earning a salary of {salary} Rs.")


Python Advantages & Disadvanges:

Adv:
1. As it is simple it increases the productivity in providing a solutio to a problem
2. It is interpreted (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop)
3. Dynamically Type
4. Free and Opensource
5. Vast Library support

Disadv:

1. slow
2. Memory efficient
3. Weak in mobile computing
4. Limited DB support
5. Unexpected Run Time errors


Variables:

It is a container to store a value.
It can be assgined a name to refer later in the program
In case of python, the datatye of the variable is decided based on the value during runtime
as variable is also an identifier, the identifier rules are applicable for variable name as well

Variable Assignment:

1. To assinga value it is not mandatory to mention the data type of the variable as python is a dynmaically typed programming language
2. It is not possible to use the variables before assigning a value to it
