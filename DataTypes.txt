Numbers:
	int
		it holds signed integer.
		integer can be of any length only restriction is there must be memory available

	float
	any decimal point values can be stored and it can be signed value
	it is accurate upto 15 decimal places. After that it rounds off the number
	any division in python results in float

	complex
	combimation of real + imaginary part
	Ex: 10+5i
	a + bi
	a - real part
	bi - imaginary part

	it is not possible to represent the imaginary part with anything apart from j
	coefficient is mandatory for the imaginary part
